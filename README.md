# Stock-Price-Prediction using LSTM based RNN model

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. This quality of the LSTM based neural network is crucial for stock price prediction
In this project I have predicted the price for State Bank of India (SBIN) Stock. Below is the list of important steps involved:
-	Data Import
-	Feature Scaling
-	Creating Sliding Window
-	Model Building
-	Prediction
